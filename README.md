Evil Hangman
===========
Here you will find my implementation of the EvilHangman game


Features:
===========
The Evil Hangman application looks like regular hangman, but then... it's evil. The app cheats by continuously changing the word the user has to guess. The app starts off with a large list of English words. Each time the user enters a letter, the app checks whether there are more words in its list with this letter (and at which location in the word) than without and then whittles the list down to the largest such subset.
Other options include for the user to change the word length and amount of guesses used in the game.
